## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to start to use media-queries and flexbox.


I'd mostly like to get better at making reponsive web sites and knowing how and when to use media-queries.


- [Example resource 1](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/) - This has a lot of examples about media quieries and responsiveness.
